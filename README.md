# mlflow
# Objective:
To use mlflow for logging and querying machine learning experiments. The task 
is to build, log, and track multiple versions of a classification model that aims to 
predict the passengers who survived the titanic shipwreck. 
Context:
Developing a machine learning model is an iterative process. It involves various 
rounds of training and evaluation. There are multiple tools that are used for 
streamlining the machine learning operations. We will be using mlflow for 
logging and tracking the experiments which will help us to analyze how accurate 
the predictions are being made and also compare the performance of the 
multiple experiments and we can tweak the model parameters to ensure the 
best performance.

# Dataset Description:
We will be using the titanic dataset.
● The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in 
history.
● On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered 
“unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. 
Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, 
resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.
● While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some 
Proprietary content.
groups of people were more likely to survive than others.
Approach:
- We have data of titanic passengers across attributes like 'PassengerId', 
'Name', 'Sex', 'Age', ticket class, fare, whether the passenger survived or 
not(target) etc.
- There are redundant columns that need to be dropped.
- There are missing values that need to be taken care of.
- There will be a few categorical variables that we will have to encode.
- Using this data, we will attempt to train a classification model that predicts 
which passengers survived the titanic shipwreck. 
- We will evaluate the model performance using scores of accuracy, 
precision, recall and f1 score.
- We will log parameters, metrics, models, and run different versions of the 
machine learning experiments using mlflow package and track and 
compare the performance using the mlflow ui.
